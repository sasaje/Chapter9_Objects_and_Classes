// Follow the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, design a class named stock that contains:
    // A string data field named symbol for the stock's symbol.
    // A string data field named name for the stock's name.
    // A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock price for the previous day.
    // A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the current time.
    // A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol and name.
    // A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.
// Write a test program that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol ORCL, the name Oracle Corporation,
// and the previous closing price of 34.5.
// Set a new current price to 34.35 and display the price-change percentage.
